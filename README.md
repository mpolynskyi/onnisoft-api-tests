### Description:
Tests are written using pytests+request for this [api](https://qa-test-develop.marlin.onnisoft.com/swagger/index.html) 

### Run instruction:
```
git clone https://github.com/mpolynskyi/onnisoft-api-tests.git
cd onnisoft-api-tests
docker-compose up
```
### Notes:
There is no any integration tests FYI.
Some tests are failing because there is a bug, some tests failing because not all endpoints are available, some tests failing because of wrong/broken Bearer token. I'd be great like to explain every not clear place, please contact with me!
